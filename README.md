# Orbitor Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Machine Learning Internship at Orbitor (formerly known as Bharat Intern). The internship provided hands-on experience with real-world datasets and strengthened my understanding of core machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment logic.

Each project focuses on a different domain and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to solve meaningful problems using structured data.

## Projects Included

### 1. House Price Prediction
Developed a regression model to estimate the selling price of houses based on features such as area, number of rooms, location, and amenities. This project focused on data analysis, feature engineering, and evaluating model performance with metrics like RÂ² and MAE.

### 2. Wine Quality Prediction
Built a classification model to predict the quality of wines using physicochemical features such as acidity, sugar, alcohol, and pH levels. This task involved supervised learning and model validation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 3. Iris Flower Classification
Implemented a multi-class classification model to categorize iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal dimensions. This classic project demonstrates feature separation and clustering in a well-known benchmark dataset.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Supervised learning (regression & classification)

## About the Internship

This internship was offered by [Orbitor](https://orbitor.in), previously known as Bharat Intern. The program was designed to provide practical exposure to core machine learning workflows and help interns build a portfolio of meaningful ML applications.
